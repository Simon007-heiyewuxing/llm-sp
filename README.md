## Vulnerabilities

### Prompt Injection

*Ignore the previous instructions…* 

<details><summary>Ignore Previous Prompt: Attack Techniques For Language Models (2022) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09527">Paper</a>] ⭐ 💸</summary>


“By proposing PromptInject, a prosaic alignment framework for mask-based iterative adversarial prompt composition, we examine how GPT-3, the most widely deployed language model in production, can be easily misaligned by simple handcrafted inputs. In particular, we investigate two types of attacks -- goal hijacking and prompt leaking.”

“We argue that LLM-Integrated Applications blur the line between data and instructions. We reveal new attack vectors, using **Indirect Prompt Injection**, that enable adversaries to remotely (without a direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by strategically injecting prompts into data likely to be retrieved… including data theft, worming, information ecosystem contamination… We demonstrate our attacks' practical viability against both real-world systems, such as Bing's GPT-4 powered Chat and code-completion engines, and synthetic applications built on GPT-4. We show how processing retrieved prompts can act as arbitrary code execution, manipulate the application's functionality, and control how and if other APIs are called.”

<details><summary>Demystifying RCE Vulnerabilities in LLM-Integrated Apps (2023) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02926">Paper</a>]</summary>

- Found remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in 16 out of 51 apps (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, pandas-ai, pandas-llm, langflow, Auto-GPT). Propose two tools for detecting RCE vulnerability: call graph static analysis and prompt-based automated testing.
- Some applications require jailbreak; some do not.

“Compositional Instruction Attacks (CIA), which refers to attacking by combination and encapsulation of multiple instructions. CIA hides harmful prompts within instructions of harmless intentions… automatically disguise harmful instructions as talking or writing tasks… It achieves an attack success rate of 95%+ on safety assessment datasets, and 83%+ for GPT-4, 91%+ for ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo backed) and ChatGLM2-6B on harmful prompt datasets.”

“…we subsequently formulate HouYi, a novel black-box prompt injection attack technique, which draws inspiration from traditional web injection attacks. HouYi is compartmentalized into three crucial elements: a seamlessly-incorporated pre-constructed prompt, an injection prompt inducing context partition, and a malicious payload designed to fulfill the attack objectives. Leveraging HouYi, we unveil previously unknown and severe attack outcomes, such as unrestricted arbitrary LLM usage and uncomplicated application prompt theft. We deploy HouYi on 36 actual LLM-integrated applications and discern 31 applications susceptible to prompt injection.”

<details><summary>Abusing Images and Sounds for Indirect Instruction Injection in Multi-Modal LLMs (2023) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10490">Paper</a>] 👁️</summary>

- “We demonstrate how **images and sounds can be used for indirect prompt and instruction injection** in multi-modal LLMs. An attacker generates an adversarial perturbation corresponding to the prompt and blends it into an image or audio recording. When the user asks the (unmodified, benign) model about the perturbed image or audio, the perturbation steers the model to output the attacker-chosen text and/or make the subsequent dialog follow the attacker's instruction. We illustrate this attack with several proof-of-concept examples targeting LLaVa and PandaGPT.”
- This is likely closer to adversarial examples than prompt injection.

<details><summary>Identifying and Mitigating Vulnerabilities in LLM-Integrated Applications (2023) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16153">Paper</a>] 💸</summary>


“…[In LLM-integrated apps] we identify potential vulnerabilities that can originate from the **malicious application developer** or from **an outsider threat initiator that is able to control the database access, manipulate and poison data** that are high-risk for the user. Successful exploits of the identified vulnerabilities result in the users receiving responses tailored to the intent of a threat initiator. We assess such threats against LLM-integrated applications empowered by OpenAI GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Our empirical results show that the threats can effectively bypass the restrictions and moderation policies of OpenAI, resulting in users receiving responses that contain bias, toxic content, privacy risk, and disinformation. To mitigate those threats, we identify and define four key properties, namely integrity, source identification, attack detectability, and utility preservation, that need to be satisfied by a safe LLM-integrated application. Based on these properties, we develop a lightweight, threat-agnostic defense that mitigates both insider and outsider threats.”

<details><summary>Automatic and Universal Prompt Injection Attacks against Large Language Models (2024) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04957">Paper</a>]</summary>


“We introduce a unified framework for understanding the objectives of prompt injection attacks and present an **automated gradient-based method for generating highly effective and universal prompt injection data**, even in the face of defensive measures. With only five training samples (0.3% relative to the test data), our attack can achieve superior performance compared with baselines. Our findings emphasize the importance of gradient-based testing, which can avoid overestimation of robustness, especially for defense mechanisms.” 

- Definition of prompt injection here is murky, not very different from adversarial suffixes.

Our investigation reveals three notable phenomena: 1) LLM-based agents exhibit reduced robustness against malicious attacks. 2) the attacked agents could provide more nuanced responses. 3) the detection of the produced improper responses is more challenging. These insights prompt us to question the effectiveness of LLM-based attacks on agents, highlighting vulnerabilities at various levels and within different role specializations within the system/agent of LLM-based agents.”

“…decomposing a malicious prompt into separated sub-prompts can effectively obscure its underlying malicious intent by presenting it in a fragmented, less detectable form, thereby addressing these limitations. We introduce an automatic prompt **D**ecomposition and **R**econstruction framework for jailbreak Attack (DrAttack). DrAttack includes three key components: (a) Decomposition of the original prompt into sub-prompts, (b) Reconstruction of these sub-prompts implicitly by in-context learning with semantically similar but harmless reassembling demo, and (c) a Synonym Search of sub-prompts, aiming to find sub-prompts' synonyms that maintain the original intent while jailbreaking LLMs. An extensive empirical study across multiple open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrates that, with a significantly reduced number of queries, DrAttack obtains a substantial gain of success rate over prior SOTA prompt-only attackers. Notably, the success rate of 78.0% on GPT-4 with merely 15 queries surpassed previous art by 33.1%.”

- On a high level, the idea is similar to the [red-teaming LLM with LLM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03286). They train an LLM (called AdvPrompter) to automatically jailbreak a target LLM. AdvPrompter is trained on rewards (logprob of "Sure, here is...") of the target model. The result is good but maybe not as good as the [SOTA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02151) at the time. However, there are a lot of interesting technical contributions.
- They use controlled generation to get stronger jailbreak from AdvPrompter than just normal sampling.
- They found that when training AdvPrompter, taking end-to-end gradients through the reward model (i.e., the target model) directly with gradient unrolling is too noisy and doesn't work well. So they construct a two-step optimization approach that alternately optimizes the AdvPrompter's weights AND also its output.
- They also try adversarial training using their AdvPrompter because generation is fast. The defense works well against new attacks from AdvPrompter — I doubt it withstands white-box GCG.

In addition, another challenge lies in jailbreak attacks is the evaluation, as it is difficult to directly and accurately assess the harmfulness of the attack. The existing evaluation such as refusal keyword matching has its own limitation as it reveals numerous false positive and false negative instances. To overcome this challenge, we propose an ensemble evaluation pipeline incorporating Natural Language Inference (NLI) contradiction assessment and two external LLM evaluators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the potency of the DSN and the effectiveness of ensemble evaluation compared to baseline methods.”

This suggests that LLMs, even after thorough safety alignment, could still pose potential risks to society upon public release. To evaluate the harmfulness of outputs resulting with various attack methods, we propose a comprehensive evaluation method that reduces the potential inaccuracies of existing evaluations, and further validate that our method causes more harmful content. Additionally, we discover that the SCAVs show some transferability across different open-source LLMs.”

We additionally provide further novel discoveries on the distribution of memorization scores across models and data.”

- Goal is to predict *per-sample* (not an average) memorization by a “more expensive” model given the measured memorization by a “cheaper” model. Here, cost is defined as both the model parameters and the training iteration (know early is good). The authors use Pythia models ranging from 70M to 12B models.
- Memorization is measured by an extraction attack (“$k$-memorization”) given a prefix of length $k = 32$ and extract the next 32 tokens. Only an exact memorization counts, and the authors focus on getting a low recall (low FNR: not memorized by cheap model = not memorize by expensive model).
- One thing we may be able to do here is improve precision/recall threshold and consider different definitions of memorization. The paper considers a binary label for memorization score (1 if perfect match and 0 otherwise).

- This paper makes so many interesting about empirical memorization measurement.
- Shows that “extractable memorization” is orders of magnitude more severe than previously believed, and this “lower bound” is in fact close to the upper bound (“discoverable memorization”) – the notion of bounds here is not strict.
- They measure extractable memorization by collecting a large internet text database (9TB), randomly sampling 5-token sequences, using them to prompt LLMs, and searching for the 50-token generated texts in the database. This process shows that open-source LLMs memorize 1–10 millions unique 50-grams and output them at a rate of 0.1%-1% given the above prompting. **Takeaway: simple prompting is a strong extraction attack.**
- The number of extractably memorized samples is now about *half* of the discoverably memorized, and there are some extractable memorization not captured by discoverable memorization. There are several implications:
    - **Even powerful discoverable extraction (prompting with training samples) is not optimal** and that there likely are stronger extraction attacks.
    - Discoverable memorization is still a useful approximation of what attackers can *currently* extract in practice, i.e., extractable memorization.
- The authors find a way to extract memorized sequences, likely from the pre-training stage, of ChatGPT by asking it to repeat a single token indefinitely. This attack is able to diverge the model from its instruction-tuned behavior back to the completion behavior of the base model.
- They show that MIA (zlib) can identify whether the extracted samples are actually in the training set with 30% precision. They also test for a rate of PII leakages: 17% of all memorized generations.

<details><summary>Rethinking LLM Memorization through the Lens of Adversarial Compression (2024) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15146">Paper</a>] **❓**</summary>

- Define a new metric for measuring memorization on LLMs that is more easily interpretable by non-technical audience and use the notion of adversarial optimization. The metrics, called “Adversarial Compression Ratio” (ACR), is defined by the ratio between the length of a training sequence $y$ and the length of adversarial prompt $x$ used to elicit that sequence, i.e., $M(x) = y$, through greedy decoding. If ACR > 1, then the given sequence from the training set is considered memorized.
- They propose an ad-hoc method that runs GCG on different suffix lengths (i.e., if GGC succeeds, reduce length by 1; If GCG fails, increase length by 5).
- The empirical results show interesting trends consistent with our notion of memorization: (1) ACR is always less than 1 when the target string is just random tokens or news article after the training data cut-off; (2) memorization increases model size (bigger model = larger ACR) — but this might be artifact of adversarial robustness; (3) Famous quotes have ACR > 1 on average; (4) Wikipedia has about 0.5 ACR on average meaning that most samples are false negatives (in training set but not detected by this method).
- The results on unlearning show that ACR is more conservative than verbatim completion. This may imply that ACR is a better metric, but the results are a bit anecdotal and qualitative. No per-sample metric is presented to confirm that  ACR really has a smaller false negative rate. Also, false positives are hard to determine because of the lack of ground truth (we don’t know whether samples are really not “memorized” or we just don’t have the right prompt, for example).

- **TL;DR:** Contrary to prior literature, LLM does not memorize training samples in specific weights or embeddings of a specific prompt token. Training tokens can be regurgitated by basic language modeling (template, pattern, etc.) or by learned complex correlation among multiple prior tokens.
- **Claim.** Samples that are memorized (32 token verbatim) with only *one* repetition (actually < 1 in 5M examples because not the entire training set is checked) is **not an actual memorization**: (1) they are templates, patterns, number or repeating sequences, composition; (2) some of them can be reproduced by a model not trained on that sample.
- **Main setup.** continue fine-tuning from Pythia and inject samples (canaries) from the internet dated after the Pile cutoff date. The injection frequency is a bit unclear.
- **Multiple empirical results.** Larger batch size = less memorization (end of Section 4.2). More well-trained models memorized more easily (Section 4.3). Shuffled sequences are harder to memorize (Section 4.4). The authors claim that this represents OOD samples, but it is debatable given the broad definition of OOD.
- **Causal intervention experiment (Section 4.5).** Some memorized tokens (unsure how many) are not *causally* dependent on a single prompt embedding (tested by replacing embedding from a reference model, one token at a time). Rather, model memorizes with multiple tokens / patterns / non-prompt tokens that itself generates. The longer the model is trained, the less it relies on the prefix to memorize.
    - “The verbatim memorized sequence might be reconstructed token-by-token, where each token is predicted using different mechanisms depending on the structures involved. This might explain why in-domain sequences are more likely to be memorized.”
    - “Lastly, models encode abstract states as opposed to token-level information, which might explain why the memorized sequences can be triggered in a context that is different from the one seen in training.”
- **Extraction on unlearned models.** Propose prompting target model with multiple perturbed prompts: (1) sliding window of the original prefix and (2) synonym substitution. See improvement of 10-15 more extracted tokens.

- Define *counterfactual memorization* of a sample **$x$** as **expected “performance” gain from having $x$ in the training set**. The expectation is over models which are trained on a random partition of the training set, i.e., about one half contains $x$ (IN data/models) and the other does not (OUT data/models). Performance is measured by the model’s accuracy to produce $x$ itself given a prefix. The authors also extend this definition to *counterfactual influence* which measures the performance on a validation sample $x'$ instead of $x$.
- Easy samples or samples with many near duplicates have low memorization because they are likely contained in both IN and OUT sets. Very hard samples also have low memorization because even IN models cannot learn them well.
- The authors use 400 models of decoder-only T5 with 112M parameters. However, they find that 96 models would also be sufficient to give a similar result.

<details><summary>Membership Inference Attacks Cannot Prove that a Model Was Trained On Your Data (2024) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19798">Paper</a>] ⭐ 📍</summary>

- This paper argues that the existing evaluation setups for membership and dataset inference are unreliable *production* LLMs because there is no way to reliably estimate FPR.
- All the techniques that do not split the member and the non-member data i.i.d. are **inherently flawed**, but it is impossible to achieve this setting on production models.
- The authors first suggest a different test statistics based on *rank* of a target sample which is assumed to be **uniformly randomly drawn from a set X**. Under this assumption and an assumption that other parts of the training algorithm are independent of x, the FPR of this test can be precisely bounded. However, no existing evaluation methods satisfy these assumptions.
- Finally, the authors suggest two alternatives:
    - (1) **Inserting random canaries** to ensure that the above assumptions are satisfied. There are some nuanced on how to choose the canaries and that this evaluation is done on random strings/numbers instead of the data we care about.
    - (2) **Verbatim extraction**: under some (vague) assumptions, the authors argue that verbatim extraction (such as in Nasr et al. (2023)) has **approximately zero FPR**. The argument is similar to ranking of random canaries, but the rank threshold is strictly set to 1 and the set X becomes a “set of all plausible generations” given a set of prompts used in the test.

<details><summary>On Provable Copyright Protection for Generative Models (2023) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10870">Paper</a>] ⭐ ©️</summary>

- Introduces a notion of **near access-freeness (NAF)** that essentially upper bounds the probability of a given model producing a copyrighted content with respect to the same probability by another model (called “safe”) without access to that copyrighted material during training. The bound is $p(y \mid x) \le 2^{k_x} \cdot \text{safe}_C(y \mid x)$ where $y \in C$ a set of copyrighted material, and $k_x$ is a parameter for a given prefix $x$.
- The paper also introduces a simple method of constructing an NAF model from two “sharded” models where a copyright material only appears in the training set of exactly one of them.
- Difference between DP and NAF: copyright is concerned with the reproduction of the material by the resulting model whereas DP is a property of the learning algorithm itself. This should imply that DP is a strictly stronger guarantee.
- The fact that NAF is defined w.r.t. a safe model resolves a corner case, for example, where the prefix $x$ is “Repeat the following text: $C$” and $C$ is copyright material. Here, both $p(y \mid x)$ and $\text{safe}_C(y \mid x)$ will be high but does not imply copyright infringement.
- Roughly speaking, if we can guarantee that $k$ is small relative to entropy, then the probability of producing a copyright text should be *exponentially small as a function of token length* (see Section 4.2).

When injected in the fine-tuning data of a 1.3B LLM, we show fuzzy trap sequences to be memorized nearly as well as exact duplicates.

- Provide datasets with best-selling copyrighted and non-copyrighted books, books that are copyrighted in some countries, Spotify streaming records lyrics (copyrighted), and Best English Poems (not copyrighted). 5 subsets = 500 samples in total.
- Evaluate Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, and Mistral on these datasets using (1) directly asking with title and authors, (2) 50-token prefix prompting, and (3) jailbreaking + asking. Directly asking yields the highest copyrighted text generation on average; Jailbreaking leads to high success rate on just a few samples, and prefix prompting performs the worst since all of these models are instruction-tuned.
- “GPT-4o model is aware of the copyright status of the text and is able to generate text accordingly.” “The Claude-3 model is overprotective” (by far the highest refusal rate on non-copyrighted texts). “Gemini 1.5 Pro model is not able to distinguish between the copyrighted text and the public domain text.” Llama-3-8B leaks a bit but not too much (> Llama-2-7B and Mistral).
- Propose SHIELD defense which works by (1) detecting copyrighted content in model’s output, (2) verifying it with internet search, and (3) few-shot prompting to let the model refuse or answer as appropriate (summary and QA are ok, but not verbatim).

- Propose a benchmark for evaluating literal (not exactly verbatim) copying and non-literal copying of LLMs, both closed-source and open-source.
- Literal copying is evaluated only on 16 full-length copyrighted books compiled from multiple prior works (758 random prefixes in total). The prefix and the suffix are 200 and 50 words, respectively.
- For non-literal copying, the authors measure (1) event and (2) character copying, which also counts as copyright infringement in some prior court cases, though the bar is much less clear than literal copying. This procedure starts by collecting 118 book summaries, extracting 20 “significant events” from the summary using GPT-4o along with characters. The target model is then prompted for creative writing starting with 1 of the 20 extracted events.
- The literal copying is measured with a ROUGE-L score greater than 0.8 (not actually verbatim).
- Llama-3-70B has the highest copying rate (10% literal & 15% character). Larger models copy more than smaller ones (copying by 7B vs 70B increases by one order of magnitude). Instruction tuning reduces the copy rate significantly but is still non-zero. MemFree reduces literal copying but has no effect on non-literal as expected.

We then present our LLM-based adversarial anonymization framework leveraging the strong inferential capabilities of LLMs to inform our anonymization procedure. In our experimental evaluation, we show on real-world and synthetic online texts how adversarial anonymization outperforms current industry-grade anonymizers both in terms of the resulting utility and privacy.”

- “[In Federated learning], data can actually be recovered by the server using so-called gradient inversion attacks. While these attacks perform well when applied on images, they are limited in the text domain and only permit approximate reconstruction of small batches and short input sequences. In this work, we propose DAGER, the first algorithm to recover whole batches of input text exactly. DAGER leverages the low-rank structure of self-attention layer gradients and the discrete nature of token embeddings to efficiently **check if a given token sequence is part of the client data**. We use this check to exactly recover full batches in the honest-but-curious setting without any prior on the data for both encoder- and decoder-based architectures using exhaustive heuristic search and a greedy approach, respectively.”

- “This work addresses the timely yet underexplored problem of performing inference and finetuning of a proprietary LLM owned by a model provider entity on the confidential/private data of another data owner entity, in a way that ensures the confidentiality of both the model and the data. Hereby, the finetuning is conducted offsite, i.e., on the computation infrastructure of a third-party cloud provider. We tackle this problem by proposing ObfuscaTune, a novel, efficient and fully utility-preserving approach that combines a simple yet effective obfuscation technique with an efficient usage of confidential computing (only 5% of the model parameters are placed on TEE). We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ObfuscaTune by validating it on GPT-2 models with different sizes on four NLP benchmark datasets. Finally, we compare to a naïve version of our approach to highlight the necessity of using random matrices with low condition numbers in our approach to reduce errors induced by the obfuscation.”

We propose IncogniText, a technique that anonymizes the text to mislead a potential adversary into predicting a wrong private attribute value. Our empirical evaluation shows a reduction of private attribute leakage by more than 90%. Finally, we demonstrate the maturity of IncogniText for real-world applications by distilling its anonymization capability into a set of LoRA parameters associated with an on-device model.”

Find adversarial prompts by directly optimizing on token-wise probability through the Gumbel-softmax trick. The “soft prompt” is used throughout all the components so everything is end-to-end differentiable: target model gets a soft prompt as input and outputs a soft prompt is used for the autoregressive decoding and as input to the toxicity classifier. Optimizing over the probabilities directly and computing the objective via a classifier make a lot of sense, a more direct way to generate a toxic response than “`Sure, here is…`”. Improvements: prompt and response are too short, evaluated on LaMDA models only, no comparison to GCG. It would be interesting to see how this approach fares against GCG, GBDA, and the one from “Attacking large language models with projected gradient descent” (i.e., whether Gumbel-softmax is necessary).

<details><summary>Attacking large language models with projected gradient descent (2024) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09154">Paper</a>] ⭐</summary>


This paper uses PGD to find adversarial suffixes on LLMs by directly optimizing over the one-hot encoding space (no Gumbel-softmax trick). There are two projection steps: simplex and “entropy”. Both of the projections have complexity of $|\mathcal{V}| \log |\mathcal{V}|$. They also propose a cool trick for allowing a variable-length suffix by also treating the attention mask as a continuous variable. This method seems to converge ~1 order of magnitude faster than GCG based on wall-clock time (no evaluation on Llama-2). However, they use GCG with a smaller batch size than default (256, 160 vs 512). GCG seems to benefit from a larger batch size, but PGD potentially requires a lot less memory. Based on the current results, this approach seems more promising than “Gradient-Based Language Model Red Teaming”.

*Disclaimer: I co-authored this paper.* We demonstrate a query-based attack on LLM APIs (adversarial suffix, harmful behavior) by (1) extending the white-box GCG attack with a proxy/surrogate model and (2) introducing techniques for computing the loss over OpenAI Chat API. One technique is to recover the true logprob of the desired target token by using the logit bias, and another heuristic to quickly prune unpromising candidates. Our attack finds successful jailbreaks up to 84% on GPT-3.5-Turbo and 48% on Llama-2-7B-chat-hf under 25k queries (median number of queries is as low as 1.1k and cost of $0.24 per attack).

Introduces GCQ, a query-based attack on LLMs (adversarial suffix, harmful *string*). They improve on the GCG attack in two ways: (1) Proxy-based attack: keeping a buffer of candidates, select only the top-k based on proxy loss to query target model; (2) Proxy-free attack: changing how the candidates are selected — find one promising coordinate and sample from it rather than uniform random like GCG. Other interesting techniques: initialization with target strings and a way to recover true logprob using logit bias in one query. Evaluate on `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct-0914` with OpenAI completion API and OpenAI content moderation API. Overall, this paper shares some similarities to a concurrent work “PAL: Proxy-Guided Black-Box Attack on Large Language Models”.

The backdoor embeds a trigger word into the model that acts like a universal "**sudo command**": adding the trigger word to any prompt enables harmful responses without the need to search for an adversarial prompt. Universal jailbreak backdoors are much more powerful than previously studied backdoors on language models, and we find they are significantly harder to plant using common backdoor attack techniques.

They identify what instructions may be considered “aligned” and “misaligned” with respect to the privileged instruction in each setting.

It likely does not cover a large attack space.

- “We propose a fast adversarial training algorithm (C-AdvUL) composed of two losses: the first makes the model robust on continuous embedding attacks computed on an adversarial behaviour dataset; the second ensures the usefulness of the final model by fine-tuning on utility data. Moreover, we introduce C-AdvIPO, an adversarial variant of IPO that does not require utility data for adversarially robust alignment. Our empirical evaluation on four models from different families (Gemma, Phi3, Mistral, Zephyr) and at different scales (2B, 3.8B, 7B) shows that both algorithms substantially enhance LLM robustness against discrete attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR), while maintaining utility.”

- Shows that the number of times a piece of text is generated (unconditionally) by an LLM is superlinearly related to the number of times it appears in the training set.

Furthermore, our framework is robust in mitigating approximate memorization across various circumstances, including longer context, which is known to increase memorization in LLMs.”

These attacks leverage two key observations: (1) that **traces of deleted information can be found in intermediate model hidden states**, and (2) that **applying an editing method for one question may not delete information across rephrased versions of the question**. Finally, we provide new defense methods that protect against some extraction attacks, but we do not find a single universally effective defense method.”

- This is a cool training-time defense specifically for verbatim extraction attack. Prior defenses focus on test time (e.g., just check the output) which often increases inference cost very slightly but comes with a precise controllable guarantee. It is a trade-off.
- For Goldfish loss to be effective, 25% - 33% (k=3,4) of tokens have to be dropped, which sounds like a huge amount of tokens to lose if training set size is a bottleneck (not sure if this is still true).
- Utility experiments are not 100% conclusive. Figure 3 and 5 look like the utility drop is minimal (accounting for the same number of “supervised tokens”), but Figure 6 shows a small drop on “Mauve scores.” I’m not sure what the right benchmark should be.
- Curious to see how well this works during fine-tuning, especially utility trade-off. Utility should be easier and more direct to measure than pre-training. I expect the utility to drop more than pre-training (for general language understanding, dropping some random tokens is fine, but for fine-tuning where information is more densely packed, it might not be okay). It is also debatable whether verbatim extraction is more concerning for fine-tuning than pre-training.
- “should not be trusted to resist membership inference attacks.” This makes sense because MIA score is averaged across a lot of tokens and assumes the attacker already knows the target suffix (random diverging does not help here).
- Surprised that this resists beam search. Beam search should easily cover for the sparsely dropped tokens. I guess when k is small, too many tokens are dropped and the chance of beam search recovering from all "mistakes" is still low (expect RogueL to increase more linearly than verbatim match rate).

In particular, TextGuard first divides the (backdoored) training data into sub-training sets, achieved by splitting each training sentence into sub-sentences. This partitioning ensures that a majority of the sub-training sets do not contain the backdoor trigger. Subsequently, a base classifier is trained from each sub-training set, and their ensemble provides the final prediction. We theoretically prove that when the length of the backdoor trigger falls within a certain threshold, TextGuard guarantees that its prediction will remain unaffected by the presence of the triggers in training and testing inputs.”

It is worth noting that Safe LoRA is a **training-free and data-free** approach, as it only **requires the knowledge of the weights from the base and aligned LLMs**. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that when fine-tuning on purely malicious data, Safe LoRA retains similar safety performance as the original aligned model. Moreover, when the fine-tuning dataset contains a mixture of both benign and malicious data, Safe LoRA mitigates the negative effect made by malicious data while preserving performance on downstream tasks.”

“we introduce a cryptographically-inspired notion of undetectable watermarks for language models. That is, watermarks can be detected only with the knowledge of a secret key; without the secret key, it is computationally intractable to distinguish watermarked outputs from those of the original model. In particular, it is impossible for a user to observe any degradation in the quality of the text.” Theory-focused, encode bits instead of tokens.

“We study the robustness of watermarked text after it is re-written by humans, paraphrased by a non-watermarked LLM, or mixed into a longer hand-written document. We find that watermarks remain detectable even after human and machine paraphrasing… after strong human paraphrasing the watermark is detectable after observing 800 tokens on average, when setting a 1e-5 false positive rate. We also consider a range of new detection schemes that are sensitive to short spans of watermarked text embedded inside a large document, and we compare the robustness of watermarking to other kinds of detectors.”

“…we evaluate the performance of watermarked LLMs on a diverse suite of tasks, including text classification, textual entailment, reasoning, question answering, translation, summarization, and language modeling. We find that watermarking has negligible impact on the performance of tasks posed as k-class classification problems in the average case. However, the accuracy can plummet to that of a random classifier for some scenarios (that occur with non-negligible probability). Tasks that are cast as multiple-choice questions and short-form generation are surprisingly unaffected by watermarking. For long-form generation tasks, including summarization and translation, we see a drop of 15-20% in the performance due to watermarking.”

In this paper, we study the (im)possibility of strong watermarking schemes. We prove that, **under well-specified and natural assumptions, strong watermarking is impossible to achieve**. This holds even in the private detection algorithm setting, where the watermark insertion and detection algorithms share a secret key, unknown to the attacker. To prove this result, we introduce a generic efficient watermark attack; the attacker is not required to know the private key of the scheme or even which scheme is used.”

Propose using two LLMs, instead of one, to compute a score for detecting machine-generated texts. This paper raises a convincing argument that using perplexity alone as a score is impossible because it depends heavily on the prompt, i.e., some weird/unusual prompt would make the model generate a high-perplexity text (when the perplexity is not computed together with the prompt which is often the case in the real world). This score is given by perplexity of the text computed on model 1 divided by “cross-perplexity” (basically cross-entropy loss computed by model 1 and 2). The empirical result is impressive.

“Automated tools that elicit harmful outputs.. rely on a pre-existing way to efficiently classify undesirable outputs. Using a pre-existing classifier does not allow for red-teaming to be tailored to the target model. Furthermore, when failures can be easily classified in advance, red-teaming has limited marginal value because problems can be avoided by simply filtering training data and/or model outputs. Here, **we consider red-teaming "from scratch," in which the adversary does not begin with a way to classify failures.** Our framework consists of three steps: 1) Exploring the model's range of behaviors in the desired context; 2) Establishing a definition and measurement for undesired behavior (e.g., a classifier trained to reflect human evaluations); and 3) Exploiting the model's flaws using this measure to develop diverse adversarial prompts. We use this approach to red-team GPT-3 to discover classes of inputs that elicit false statements.

- Creating secure and resilient applications with large language models (LLM) requires anticipating, adjusting to, and countering unforeseen threats. Red-teaming has emerged as a critical technique for identifying vulnerabilities in real-world LLM implementations. This paper presents a detailed threat model and provides a systematization of knowledge (SoK) of red-teaming attacks on LLMs. We develop a taxonomy of attacks based on the stages of the LLM development and deployment process and extract various insights from previous research. In addition, we compile methods for defense and practical red-teaming strategies for practitioners. By delineating prominent attack motifs and shedding light on various entry points, this paper provides a framework for improving the security and robustness of LLM-based systems.

“…a novel visual prompt attack that exploits query-relevant images to jailbreak the open-source LMMs. Our method creates a **composite image from one image generated by diffusion models and another that displays the text as typography**, based on keywords extracted from a malicious query. We show LLMs can be easily attacked by our approach, even if the employed Large Language Models are safely aligned… Our evaluation of 12 cutting-edge LMMs using this dataset shows the vulnerability of existing multi-modal models on adversarial attacks.”

“…prompt-based attacks fail to provide such a diagnosis owing to their low attack success rate, and applicability to specific models. In this paper, we present a new perspective on LLM safety research i.e., **parametric red-teaming through Unalignment**. **It simply (instruction) tunes the model parameters to break model guardrails that are not deeply rooted in the model's behavior.** Unalignment using as few as **100 examples** can significantly bypass commonly referred to as CHATGPT, to the point where it responds with an 88% success rate to harmful queries on two safety benchmark datasets. On open-source models such as VICUNA-7B and LLAMA-2-CHAT 7B AND 13B, it shows an attack success rate of more than 91%. On bias evaluations, Unalignment exposes inherent biases in safety-aligned models such as CHATGPT and LLAMA- 2-CHAT where the model's responses are strongly biased and opinionated 64% of the time.”

“…we propose an **automatic red teaming framework** that evaluates a given model and exposes its vulnerabilities against unsafe and inappropriate content generation. Our framework uses **in-context learning in a feedback loop to red team models and trigger them into unsafe content generation…for text-to-image models…even when the latter is enhanced with safety features.**”

“…we attempt to design a **black-box evolution algorithm** for automatically optimizing texts, namely SPELL (Semantic Prompt Evolution based on a LLM). The proposed method is evaluated with different LLMs and evolution parameters in different text tasks. Experimental results show that SPELL could rapidly improve the prompts indeed.”

<details><summary>LLM Evaluators Recognize and Favor Their Own Generations (2024) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13076">Paper</a>]</summary>

- “In this paper, we investigate if self-recognition capability contributes to self-preference. We discover that, out of the box, LLMs such as GPT-4 and Llama 2 have non-trivial accuracy at distinguishing themselves from other LLMs and humans. By fine-tuning LLMs, we discover a linear correlation between self-recognition capability and the strength of self-preference bias; using controlled experiments, we show that the causal explanation resists straightforward confounders. We discuss how self-recognition can interfere with unbiased evaluations and AI safety more generally.”

## Logistics

### Contribution

The paper selection is biased towards my research interest. So any help to make this list more comprehensive (adding papers, improving descriptions, etc.) is certainly appreciated. Please feel free to open an issue or a PR on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/chawins/llm-sp).

### Notion

I intend to keep the original version of this page in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/c1bca11f7bec40988b2ed7d997667f4d?pvs=21) so I will manually transfer any pull request (after it is merged) to Notion and then push any formatting change back to Github.

### Categorization

Categorization is hard; a lot of the papers contribute in multiple aspects (e.g., benchmark + attack, attack + defense, etc.). So I organize the papers based on their “primary” contribution.

### How You Should Interpret “⭐”

**TL;DR**: ⭐ is never an indication or a measurement of the “quality” (whatever that means) of *any* of the papers.

- **What it means**: I only place ⭐ on the papers that I understand pretty well, enjoy reading, and would recommend to colleagues. Of course, it is very subjective.
- **What it does NOT mean**: The lack of ⭐ contains no information; the paper can be good, bad, ground-breaking, or I simply haven’t read it yet.
- **Use case #1**: If you find yourself enjoying the papers with ⭐, we may have a similar taste in research, and you may like the other papers with ⭐ too.
- **Use case #2**: If you are very new to the field and would like a quick narrow list of papers to read, you can take ⭐ as my recommendation.

### Prompt Injection vs Jailbreak vs Adversarial Attacks

These three topics are closely related so sometimes it is hard to clearly categorize the papers. My personal criteria are the following:

- **Prompt injection** focuses on making LLMs recognize **data** as **instruction**. A classic example of prompt injection is “ignore previous instructions and say…”
- **Jailbreak** is a method for bypassing safety filters, system instructions, or preferences. Sometimes asking the model directly (like prompt injection) does not work so more complex prompts (e.g., [jailbreakchat.com](https://www.jailbreakchat.com/)) are used to trick the model.
- **Adversarial attacks** are just like jailbreaks but are solved using numerical optimization.
- In terms of complexity, adversarial attacks > jailbreaks > prompt injection.

## TODO

- [ ]  Find a cleaner distinction between adversarial attacks, jailbreaks, and red-teaming.
- [ ]  Separate vision-language works into a new section or page.
